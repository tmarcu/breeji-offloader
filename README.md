## How to use
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/tmarcu/breeji-offloader/releases).
2. Run the executable.
3. Grab your mobile device and point it at the generated QR code, this takes you to the self-hosted web app.
   1. You **must** be on the same network as the computer running the app.
4. Click anywhere in the box or drag and drop your files to upload them to your computer.
   1. Files will automatically start uploading to your computer in a directory called `mobile` that can be
   found in the same directory where the binary was run from.
   2. Files are automatically numbered by order of upload. If you close the app and reopen it, the numbering
   will continue from the latest file uploaded. Any extension should be accepted & preserved, but the name will
   be auto-generated for all files.

## How to build
1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Run `go get github.com/tmarcu/breeji-offloader`.
3. Run `make build [platform]` where platform is one of `windows`, `linux`, `darwin` or `all`.
4. The executable will be in the `build` directory.

## What could I use this for?
Quickly transfer files from your mobile device(s) to your computer regardless of the platform you're on:
- You own a Windows/Linux PC and iPhone, and you want to transfer files from your iPhone to your PC, _easily_.
- You own a Mac and Android/Other type of phone, and you want to transfer files from your phone to your Mac.
- You are hosting an event and you want to quickly transfer photos from your guests' phones to your computer:
  - Print out the generated QR Code and slap it on the wall, tell guests to upload event photos directly to you (if they connected to your network).
- You can't convince your friends to install a file sharing app, but you can convince them to open a web page.
